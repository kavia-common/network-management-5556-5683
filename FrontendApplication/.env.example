# PUBLIC INTERFACE
# React Frontend environment example for API connectivity.
# Set the backend API base URL explicitly to avoid mixed-content and cross-origin issues.
# In this environment, both services are served over HTTPS with different ports.
# Update this value if your preview host differs.

# Base URL for the Backend API (MUST include protocol and port)
# Example for local dev: http://localhost:3001
# Example for this preview environment (HTTPS):
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://vscode-internal-34539-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3001

REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS=false

# Default page size for devices list pagination
REACT_APP_PAGINATION_PAGE_SIZE_DEFAULT=10
